## :rocket: Introduction

    To create synthesis images (when doing ray tracing, for example), potential
    intersection points between light rays and scene objects (here cylinders,
    spheres and cones) must be computed.
    This is exactly what you have to do in this project.

    To do so, you need to write a 3 dimensional equation of the considered surface,
    and inject into it the equation of the straight line representing the light
    ray. You’ll get a quadratic equation, with 0, 1, 2 or an infinite
    number of solutions that will give you the intersection points coordinates.

    The straight line is defined by the coordinates of a point by which it passes
    through and the coordinates of a parallel vector.
